WIP - README

This is the new home of the T3D project.

The point of using a mono-repo is to allow faster iterations on different part of the project.
It also decrease greatly the work to maintain the project.



TODO:
 - Use 1.0.x branch of library instead of 1.1.0
 - Rewrite build scripts for examples
 - Update ESLint/Prettier
 Libary:
