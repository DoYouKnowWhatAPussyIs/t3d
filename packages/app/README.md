Tyria 3D
========

Tyria 3D lets you explore textured Guild Wars 2 map files in 3D, directly in your web browser. The purpose of this project is to allow a unique look into the amazing world of Guild Wars 2, Tyria. This site atempts to visualize some of the in-game graphics but is missing the animation, lighting and visual effects that makes Guild Wars 2 the most beautiful MMO out there. 

## Welcome to a developement version of Tyria 3D
I am not the author of Tyria 3D, this work is only modifications of the existing code. But still, don't hesitate to report bugs or bring your expertise !
Do you want to try it live ? [Come here !](https://njibhu.github.io/Tyria3DApp/)

## What's new ?
* 1.0.5
This is not so big update but with one cool feature.
You can now browse a map to find something cool and then share the url to a friend. It will automatically load the map and the camera will be at the same place than when you share it!
The navigation menu and the loading messages had some bugs that are now fixed.

* 1.0.4
This version of Tyria 3D is ported to the actual modifications I made to the Tyria3DLibrary.
It allows you to browse on other (recent) browsers than google chrome ! (Currently only tested on Firefox) and brings few little modifications I made to the library.
The map list have been updated with the name of the maps ! Enjoy 76 new maps automatically detected on startup with the new way they are sorted !

## TODO ?
 * The SASS is just a copypaste but actually does not represent the css used.
 * UI code rework (it's a bit hacky)
 * Keyboard localization support
 * Would be neat to look a bit at the skydomes (especially since PoF)
 * Some transparent textures are not properly rendered
 * Optimisations ? (LOD could be improved)
 * Animations/Shaders/Lighting....
